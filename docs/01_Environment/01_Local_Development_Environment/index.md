I prefer a development environment, where every developer is able to work on his own sandboxed local server with the tools they are most comfortable with. A sandboxed development environment will reduce the risk of influencing or destroying other developers work. You will have full control on the configuration of your server environment plus full access to any logfiles you'll probably need during development and debugging.

To work in a local sandboxed server environment, you have plenty of options. You can either work with a preconfigured server sandbox like [Xampp on Windows or Mamp on Mac OS](./Environment/Local_Development_Environment/Xampp_&_Mamp) that is pretty easy to install and handle and provide you with a fully working server stack right out of the box. If you prefer more control over your server environment, you should probably try out [Vagrant](./Environment/Local_Development_Environment/Vagrant). If you are working on a Mac, you can also use the natively shipped Apache.
